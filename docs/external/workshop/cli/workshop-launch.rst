.. _ref_workshop_launch:

workshop launch
---------------

Construct one or many workshops using their definitions.

.. rubric:: Usage

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop launch <WORKSHOP>... [flags]

.. rubric:: Description


This command constructs the workshops listed as arguments by going over their
definitions and installing their components. For each workshop, it:

- Checks the workshop definition and identifies necessary actions

- Retrieves the required components, such as base and SDKs

- Runs SDK setup hooks to initialise the working state

- On success, ties the workshop to the project and starts it


The '--wait-on-error' option pauses the launch if an error occurs.
Thus, you can fix the error and resume the operation or abort and revert it.
This option can only be used with a single workshop.
If multiple workshops are listed and an error occurs,
the operation is aborted and no workshops are constructed.


Notes:

- Names listed as arguments must match respective 'name:' values in definitions.

- To update an existing workshop, use 'workshopÂ refresh' instead.

- SDKs are installed in the order they are listed in the definition.


.. rubric:: Examples


Launch the 'nimble' and 'jazzy' workshops in the current project directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop launch nimble jazzy


The name is optional if the project has only one workshop:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop launch
