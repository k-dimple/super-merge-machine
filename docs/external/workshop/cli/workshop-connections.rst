workshop connections
--------------------

List interface connections.

.. rubric:: Usage

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop connections [<WORKSHOP>] [flags]

.. rubric:: Description


This command lists the connections between interface plugs and slots
for the entire project or a single workshop within it.
Each line represents a connection between a plug and a slot via an interface;
additional notes, including specific plug bindings, are provided as needed.


Notes:

- The output lists connections created with 'workshopÂ connect' as 'manual'.

- The '--all' option needn't be used with an argument;
  if a workshop is supplied, disconnected plugs are also listed.

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop connections nimble


List connections for all workshops in the current project directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop connections
